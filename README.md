## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **View Default Location**: The app loads with Tashkent, Uzbekistan as the default location
2. **Click the Map**: Click anywhere on the map to view air quality for that location
3. **Use Your Location**: Click "Use My Location" to automatically detect your position
4. **Explore Data**: View PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ levels, AQI, and weather forecasts

### Understanding Air Quality Index (AQI)

| AQI Range | Level | Color | Health Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| 0-60 | Good | üü¢ Green | Air quality is good - enjoy outdoor activities |
| 61-100 | Moderate | üü° Yellow | Limit prolonged outdoor exertion |
| 101-150 | Unhealthy | üü† Orange | Sensitive groups should limit time outside |
| 151+ | Very Unhealthy | üî¥ Red | Avoid outdoor activity |

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` with auto-reload enabled.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /air-quality?lat={lat}&lon={lon}` - Get air quality data for coordinates
- `GET /weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}` - Get current weather conditions
- `GET /forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&days={days}` - Get weather forecast

### Example API Response

```json
{
  "aggregated": {
    "pm25": 10.0,
    "pm10": 11.5,
    "no2": 6.0
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-10-05T17:30:00Z",
  "locations": [
    {
      "location": "Air Quality Station (41.31, 69.28)",
      "coordinates": {
        "latitude": 41.3111,
        "longitude": 69.2797
      },
      "measurements": {
        "pm25": 10.0,
        "pm10": 11.5,
